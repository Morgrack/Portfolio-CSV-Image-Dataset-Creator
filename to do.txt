1. Make Prompt look pretty.
2. Add back box to currentImage and count in top left.
3. Add confirmation boxes to currentImage.

Set can be test training validation, label is whatever, bounding box should include 4 vertices, not just 2
Need inputs to define set and label (dropdown and text input in the prompt object)
